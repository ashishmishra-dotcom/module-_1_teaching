Testing is the major control measure used during software development.
Its basic function is to detect errors in the software. During requirement
analysis and design, the output is a document that is usually textual and no
executable. After the coding phase, computer programs are available that
can be executed for testing purpose. This implies that testing not only, has
to uncover errors introduced during coding, but also errors introduced
during previous phase. Thus the goal of testing is to uncover the
requirements, design and coding errors in the programs. TheSourcecode
declared above for the program of Scientific Calculator has been tested
and it has been found that the above source code is okay and correct.The
program involves many type of conversions. These conversions has to
done carefully
