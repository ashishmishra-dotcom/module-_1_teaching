**Scientific Calculator :**
The calculator was written by Rolf Howarth in early 1996.
A fully featured scientific calculator with proper operator
precedence is implemented, including trig functions and
logarithms, factorials, 12 levels of parentheses, logs to base 2
(a handy function for information entropists!), bitwise logical
operators, hex, octal, binary and ASCII display.
The calculator is written in JavaScript and you are welcome to
view the JavaScript source (visible within the HTML page) for
personal educational purposes as long as you recognize that it
is copyrighted and not in the public domain it can me modified in other language also.
This calculator is
now available as part of Hummingbird's Enterprise Information
Portal. All enquiries regarding licensing the calculator should
be directed to Hummingbird Ltd.In most countries, students use calculators for schoolwork. There was
some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic arithmetic skills
would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of
the ability to perform calculations "in the head", with some curricula
restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been
obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation
techniques and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate
guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of
mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued
that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy,
or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic
concepts.
There are other concerns - for example, that a pupil could use the
calculator in the wrong fashion but believe the answer because that was
the result given. Teachers try to combat this by encouraging the student
to make an estimate of the result manually and ensuring it roughly
agrees with the calculated result. Also, it is possible for a child to type in
−1 × −1 and obtain the correct answer '1' without realizing the principle
involved. In this sense, the calculator becomes a crutch rather than a
learning tool, and it can slow down students in exam conditions as they
check even the most trivial result on a calculator.

This is an online scientific calculator which is used as on the user demand and perform various operation like the trignometric operation, log and arithmatic operations . This is an project made after looking the various requirement of the user for the calculation and operation.

Requirements This will be able to distinguish between the high level requirements and low level requirements and able to link between the processes.

There are basically two types of requirement require in my proect whose name is "Scientific & Arithmatic Calculator ". 1: High Level Requirement a)User. b)Windows or Linux operating system. c)Laptop or Personal Computer(proper functioning). d)Calculation Problem. 2: Low Level Requirement a)Arithmatic operation b)Loops c)Switch cases d)If Else operation e)Input and output operation

4W 1H Who, What, When, Where and How?

Who: This is an application used by the student and the businessman for their calculation.This is not only for the matric or lower class students but also for the higher secondary students also.

What: Basically this is an online calculating application made after seeing the online pendamic and modern technology because no one wants to invest more time in calculation . When: The use of this application can be made anywhere like mobile apps if developed to its fullest. Where: The use can be on any web browser, as a mobile application, or any other suitable means. How: With proper work flow and data collection, combining with the management of official information systems this project can be implemented and evolved for many suitable applications.

**SWOT Analysis Strength: By making this application you are not only making the world digital but also making the world smarter. Advantages of Scientific calculator App: ❖ Reduced time ❖ Enable advanced level of calculation in couple of time. ❖Reduce the investment of money on calculator and its totally free of cost.

**Weakness: Some of the disadvantages are: At a time only one operation can be performed . When you finish with one operation user have to start from begining. No more then one operation can apply or perform at a time .

**Opportunuties: Many oppotunities are present to make the things easier, safer, robust. If all things are taken care then there is a huge growth of these kinds of applications in the near future.

**Threat: Your personal data may be at risk sometimes. Misuse of personal data may lead to attacks to the application and inturn to the system
