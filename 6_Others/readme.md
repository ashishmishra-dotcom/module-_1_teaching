**ABOUT THE PROJECT AND FUTURE SCOPE**
In most countries, students use calculators for schoolwork. There was
some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic arithmetic skills
would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of
the ability to perform calculations "in the head", with some curricula
restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been
obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation
techniques and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate
guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of
mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued
that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy,
or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic
concepts.
There are other concerns - for example, that a pupil could use the
calculator in the wrong fashion but believe the answer because that was
the result given. Teachers try to combat this by encouraging the student
to make an estimate of the result manually and ensuring it roughly
agrees with the calculated result. Also, it is possible for a child to type in
−1 × −1 and obtain the correct answer '1' without realizing the principle
involved. In this sense, the calculator becomes a crutch rather than a
learning tool, and it can slow down students in exam conditions as they
check even the most trivial result on a calculator.

**FUTURE SCOPE**
Our project will be able to implement in future after making some
changes and modifications as we make our project at a very low level.
So the modifications that can be done in our project are:
To make it screen touch so no need to touch key buttons and one more
change which can we made is to add snaps of the person who use it.
