**Description**
This is an online scientific calculator which is used as on the user demand and perform various operation like the trignometric operation, log and arithmatic operations . This is an project made after looking the various requirement of the user for the calculation and operation.

**Requirements**
This will be able to distinguish between the high level requirements and low level requirements and able to link between the processes.

There are basically two types of requirement require in my proect whose name is "Scientific & Arithmatic  Calculator ".
1: High Level Requirement
   a)User.
   b)Windows or Linux operating system.
   c)Laptop or Personal Computer(proper functioning). 
   d)Calculation Problem.
2: Low Level Requirement
   a)Arithmatic operation
   b)Loops
   c)Switch cases
   d)If Else operation
   e)Input and output operation

Who, What, When, Where and How?**

Who: This is an application used by the student and the businessman for their calculation.This is not only for the matric or lower class students but also for the higher secondary students also.

What: Basically this is an online calculating application made after seeing the online pendamic and modern technology because no one wants to invest more time in calculation .
When: The use of this application can be made anywhere like mobile apps if developed to its fullest.
Where: The use can be on any web browser, as a mobile application, or any other suitable means.
How: With proper work flow and data collection, combining with the management of official information systems this project can be implemented and evolved for many suitable applications.
**SWOT Analysis**
Strength: By making this application you are not only making the world digital but also making the world smarter. 
Advantages of Scientific calculator App: 
❖ Reduced time 
❖ Enable advanced level of calculation in couple of time.
❖Reduce the investment of money on calculator and its totally free of cost.

Weakness: Some of the disadvantages are: At a time only one operation can be performed . When you finish with one operation user have to start from begining. No more then one operation can apply or perform at a time .

Opportunuties: Many oppotunities are present to make the things easier, safer, robust. If all things are taken care then there is a huge growth of these kinds of applications in the near future.

Threat: Your personal data may be at risk sometimes. Misuse of personal data may lead to attacks to the application and inturn to the system
